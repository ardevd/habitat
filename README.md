# Habitat

Habitat is a Z-Way controller app for Android. Using the ZAutomation API the app is able to list and control devices, locations and notifications. 

Habitat is still being actively developed but with the plethora of available Z-wave devices out there it's impossible for me to provide support for all of them. Suggestions, feedback and input is therefore very welcome. If something doesnt work, please report it.
