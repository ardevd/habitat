# Habitat

Habitat is a Z-Way controller app for Android. Using the ZAutomation API the app is able to list and control devices, locations and notifications. It requires a Z-way based controller such as the Razberry.  

Habitat is still being actively developed but with the plethora of available Z-wave devices out there it's impossible for me to provide support for all of them. Suggestions, feedback and input is therefore very welcome. If something doesnt work, please report it. Please ensure you're using the latest Z-way firmware on your controller.

# Requirements

* Z-way controller. Version 2.3.7 is the currently supported version.
* Android 23 or newer.
